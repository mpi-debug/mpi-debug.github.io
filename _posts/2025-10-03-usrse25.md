I will be attending the [US-RSE'25 conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/) in Philadelphia, PA, from October 6–8, 2025. I look forward to connecting with fellow research software engineers as well as current and past [BSSw fellows](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program).

As science and engineering increasingly rely on computer simulation and modeling, research software—and the people who develop it—play a critical role in enabling discovery. The US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) is a community-driven effort focused on the increasingly important role of the Research Software Engineer. I am excited to be part of the US-RSE and to give back to this growing community.

For US-RSE’25 attendees visiting this website, I invite you to participate in a short 1-minute survey and to share your ideas or comments on this GitHub discussion page.

Thank you!
